# ad_filter2hosts
Convert domains filters (DNS, abp, ublock) to hosts list with 0.0.0.0 IP

I edited a script that I found on https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/4p2tp7/adding_easylist_and_other_adblocklike_sources_to/, to convert and DNS to a hosts filter list, to be added on AdAway (https://github.com/AdAway/AdAway)
